# Kanban Domain

## Overview

The `kanban_domain` is a core part of the Kanban Vision API. It's responsible for defining the domain logic and the state of the application. It's built with Elixir and leverages the power of functional programming and the actor model to provide a robust and scalable solution for simulating a Kanban system.

## Structure

The `kanban_domain` is structured into two main parts: `Agents` and `Domain`.

### Agents

Agents in Elixir are a way to maintain state. In the context of the `kanban_domain`, agents are used to manage the state of different entities in the system such as `Boards`, `Organizations`, and `Simulations`.

For example, the `Boards` agent is responsible for managing the state of a Kanban board. It maintains information about the board's workflow and can be interacted with to update the state of the board.

### Domain

The `Domain` part of the `kanban_domain` defines the data structures and business logic of the application. It includes modules like `Board`, `Workflow`, `Ability`, `Audit`, `Organization`, `Project`, `ServiceClass`, `Simulation`, `Step`, `Task`, and `Worker` which define the structure of these entities and how they behave.

For example, the `Board` module defines a data structure with fields like `id`, `name`, `workflow`, and `workers`. It also includes a `new` function to create a new instance of a board.
